# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses **linear regression** to predict student performance based on:
- **Previous Scores**
- **Hours Studied**

Achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.99**, showing strong predictive accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.83
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 5.24
- **R-Squared Score:** 0.99

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `student_performance.ipynb` â†’ Full Python Notebook with **code & analysis**.
- `performance_model.pkl` â†’ Saved **trained model** for future use.
- `requirements.txt` â†’ List of dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install).
